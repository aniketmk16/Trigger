# Project Name: Trigger V0.5
## Tagline: Because every women' security matters

## Description:
Trigger is a location sharing app made Under the Code of War Hackathon by Team NO NAME.
Trigger app is a one stop app to share location in an easier and faster manner to a pre-selected contact by the user.It is designed keeping in mind the objective of women safety.In some situations it isn't possible to share location using Google Maps as one may have to rely on internet as well as the loading time for the app.Trigger solves this issue and helps share location quickly.

## Challenges Faced:
* One of the hurdles faced by us was to get the location of the user when the parameter of altitude was added.We could easily get the latitude and longitude but getting altitude was tricky.Later on we figure out that

* The next biggest hurdle in location sharing is getting the perfect location.Since we wanted to rely less on the internet availibility and GPS it was a little challenging to figure out the location.We then used the Network provider's location to overcome this challenge.

## Technologies Used:
Android Studio IDE,JAVA,Kotlin,XML,SQLite3,Library 1,Library 2,Library 3

* Functionality to locate and give directions to the user for nearest Police station or safe
place like Banks, post offices or any other govt. office with security services.
* Improvements in the UI.
* Login system to restore previous data and reuse the account after switching the
devices.
* Location sharing without active Internet connection with the help of cell towers of
network providers.
